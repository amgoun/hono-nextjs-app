Next.js Project with Hono API

This project leverages Next.js for building the frontend and Hono for handling API routes. By using Hono instead of Next.js route handlers, you can achieve a more modular and performant API layer, making it an excellent alternative.

Why Use Hono with Next.js?

Hono is a minimal, fast, and simple web framework that seamlessly integrates with Next.js. By using Hono, you can:

    Improve API performance: Hono's lightweight nature ensures faster response times.
    Modularize your backend: Separate your API logic from the Next.js routing system for better maintainability.
    Enhanced developer experience: Hono's intuitive syntax makes it easier to build and manage API routes.

Getting Started

First, run the development server:

bash

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
